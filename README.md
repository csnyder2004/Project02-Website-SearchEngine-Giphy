# Project02-Website-SearchEngine-Giphy
My name is Cole Snyder. This Project is to exhibit my CSS and JS skills by creating a website with a search engine.
I decided to make this Gif search website themed for my favorite football team. I wanted to add in my own creative touch so I made it Vols themed in honor of our football team getting our first win this season.
I have linked in an SCSS through the CSS. Main.js and style.css have been linked into my html. I added in my API key so it links directly to Giphy. This whole website is powered by Giphy.
